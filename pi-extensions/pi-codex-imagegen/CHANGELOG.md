# @oai404iao/pi-codex-imagegen

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- fca54ca: Add an exact `openai-codex/gpt-6-astra` Responses Lite profile using the model
  descriptor supplied by the supported Pi baseline.
  
  Promote `config.json.imageGeneration` to a global generation gate. Disabling it
  now omits image tools, background commands, presentation and provider injection,
  blocks standalone/direct execution before network I/O, and leaves all unrelated
  model-profile behavior unchanged.
- fca54ca: Raise every public plugin's Pi peer floor to `>=0.85.1`. Pi 0.85.0 is excluded
  because its published SDK imports are broken; the private tree-continue
  experiment is audited for 0.85.1 too but remains blocked from publication.

### Patch Changes

- 76bea30: Expose each Pi extension through a package-root `index.ts` facade so compact
  startup summaries show the package name without an internal `:src` suffix.
  Package resource filters that explicitly selected `src/index.ts` must select
  `index.ts` instead.
- 952cb3f: Pin the supported-package development baseline to Pi 0.85.1 while retaining
  the Pi 0.84.2 peer floor. Add full floor/target compatibility verification,
  including independently installed Codex tarballs and real-loader checks.
  The private tree-continue hook remains exact-0.84.2 and disabled under the target
  loader. No Codex catalog, protocol, default capability or publication eligibility
  is changed.
- 952cb3f: Split Codex ownership into a non-registering runtime library and independent core,
  web-search and image-generation packages. Retain the existing package name and
  subagent-inline entry as compatibility composition paths. Share capability and
  identity lifecycles through a version-checked session broker so equivalent package
  installations do not duplicate providers, tools, commands or renderers.
  
  New packages remain private/blocked. Release artifact preparation now rejects
  bundles with unpublished workspace dependencies; this change does not authorize
  their bootstrap or publication. Runtime versions must match when composing
  packages. Hosted capabilities still require core; standalone clients retain the
  existing catalog, Pi authentication, configuration paths and opt-in fallbacks.
- 32ba01f: Prepare the split Codex alpha cohort for separately approved, dependency-first
  bootstrap. Update package documentation and the four new manifests to reflect
  bootstrap eligibility, without enabling guarded publication or claiming real
  endpoint acceptance. The compatibility bundle requires the matching alpha
  dependencies; previously published monolith tarballs remain unchanged.
- 952cb3f: Cancel background image jobs when their session is replaced or closed. Scope
  job status and timers to the registering instance, consume late auth/results,
  and suppress stale UI and new writes after cancellation. Already-started
  server generation or disk writes cannot be rolled back.

  At this split-stage checkpoint, new packages remained private/blocked; the
  alpha-bootstrap preparation entry supersedes that status. Artifact preparation rejects
  bundles with unpublished workspace dependencies; this change does not authorize
  their bootstrap or publication. Runtime versions must match when composing
  packages. Hosted capabilities still require core; standalone clients retain the
  existing catalog, Pi authentication, configuration paths and opt-in fallbacks.
